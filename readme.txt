This ZIP file contains the solution submission by INFOSYS 300/SOFTENG 762 Group 1. The solution includes a UiPath Automation Programme that log into iPayroll (the payroll system for company: NZ TRT Ltd), extract leave data for its employees in the following 30 days, and update the leave data as appointments in the outlook calendar. The leave data manipulation includes adding new generated leaves, deleting leaves that has been cancelled and color coding appointments for employees from different departments. The main components of this ZIP file are {project.json} that holds the uiPath project dependencies, a {Main.xaml} file that serves as the entrance to run the programme. And {workflows} folder that contains the sequence files to build up the entire automation process.

This solution is designed to only be operatable on a authenticated machine from our client NZ TRT Ltd, this is because the login process into ipayroll requires 2FA code authentication, in which can only be generated from the verfied machine in real time. To run this solution would require to connect to the verified machine through TeamViewer and get control of it. Then, unzip this folder and start uiPath Studio, open the project with the directory of {project.json}. And click "Run" button on the top left options bar. Note,the first time running the solution on the machine may be required to enter the outlook account info.

Several steps above require privileged account details of NZ TRT, to get full access please contact John James, our project sponsor. Detail shows below:
